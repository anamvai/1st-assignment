            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>We love eating burger which is filled with cheese and vegetables. The more vegetables you add, the better it tastes. My personal favourite is lettuce. it gives the burger the right amount of freshness and crunchiness</p>

            <p>We always eat us burger with ketchup. Most importantly, the thing we love about eating burgers is that I get to eat French fires along with them. They work as a great side to the dish and also make my stomach full.</p>
